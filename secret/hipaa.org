** Overview 
*HIPAA* is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. 

This is a /federal act/ which must be complied with at all times, else face a fine. It has two key provisions:

- Privacy Rule :: Establish a national standard to protect the privacy/security of health information.
- Security Rule :: Establish a national standard protecting the privacy/security of health information that is held or transferred.
*** PHI (Protected Health Information) 
The following should *always* be gated by a secure channel:

- Social security number
- Name
- Address
- Date of birth
  
** The HIPAA Privacy Rule 
Patients can now ask for EMRs via an electronic medium. They reserve the right to keep certain information private from their health plan. This data cannot be sold or used for marketing purposes without the holder's permission.

Patients must be notified of these rights.

** The HIPAA Security Rule 
We are responsible for keeping PHI secure.
